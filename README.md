# Workout Timer App

The Workout Timer App is a simple Android application that allows users to time their workouts and rest periods. The app provides a countdown timer with a progress bar, allowing users to set the duration of their workout in minutes. Once the timer is started, the progress bar updates in real-time, visually indicating the remaining time.

The app includes the following features:

1. **Workout Timer:** Users can enter the desired workout duration in minutes and start the timer with a click of a button. The countdown timer displays the remaining time and updates the progress bar accordingly.
2. **Rest Phase:** When the workout timer reaches the halfway mark, the app automatically pauses the current activity and transitions to a rest phase. The user is then redirected to another activity to take a rest.
3. **Resume Functionality:** After completing the rest phase, users can return to the workout phase and resume the timer from where it left off. The app maintains the timer state, ensuring a seamless workout experience.
4. **Completion Message:** When the workout timer finishes, the app displays a completion message indicating the end of the workout. The progress bar disappears, and the user is presented with the option to return to the main screen.

The Workout Timer App provides a user-friendly interface and intuitive controls, making it convenient for users to track their workout durations and rest periods effectively. Whether it's for fitness enthusiasts, athletes, or anyone looking to time their workouts, this app offers a reliable and straightforward solution.

This app was developed using Kotlin and follows modern Android development practices. The code is well-structured, easy to understand, and can serve as a foundation for further customization or enhancements.
